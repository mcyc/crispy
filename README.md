Computational Ridge Identification with SCMS for Python

This code is a python implementation of the generalized Subspace Constrained Mean Shift (SCMS) algorithm, translated and modified from the [R-code](https://sites.google.com/site/yenchicr/algorithm) developed by [Yen-Chi Chen](http://faculty.washington.edu/yenchic/) (University of Washington).
