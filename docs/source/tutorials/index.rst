Overview
--------

In these tutorials, you will learn how to:

1. **Detect Density Ridges**:

   - Identify ridges in 2D or 3D `.fits` images and save the results in :doc:`Find Ridges <find_ridge>`.

2. **Post-Process Results** :

   - Grid ridge detection results in :doc:`Find Ridges <find_ridge>`.
   - Prune branches from skeletons to extract branchless structures (spines) in :doc:`pruning`.

3. **Visualize Results**:

   - Generate interactive 3D visualizations of the results in :doc:`visualize`.
