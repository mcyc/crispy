Getting Started
---------------
Eager to start using **CRISPy**? See :doc:`Quick Start <quick_start>` to begin.

Statistical Methods
-------------------

**CRISPy**'s underlying methodology, its implementation, and its application
on 3D astrophysical images are described in:

    - Chen, M. C.-Y., et al. "Velocity-Coherent Filaments in NGC 1333: Evidence for Accretion Flow?"
      ApJ (`2020 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...891...84C/abstract>`_).

The generalized statistical framework behind **CRISPy** and its specialized application on structured
(non-image) astrophysical data are respectively presented in:

    - Chen, Y.-C., et al. "Generalized Mode and Ridge Estimation."
      (`2014 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1803>`_).

    - Chen, Y.-C., et al. "Cosmic Web Reconstruction through Density Ridges: Method and Algorithm."
      MNRAS (`2015 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05303>`_).

For the initial development of SCMS in statistics, please see:

    - Ozertem, U., and Erdogmus, D. "Locally Defined Principal Curves and Surfaces."
      JMLR (`2011 <https://jmlr.org>`_).
